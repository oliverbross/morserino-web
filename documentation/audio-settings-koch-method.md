ADVANCED AUDIO EFFECTS - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!
Perfect! I've implemented all the advanced audio effects based on your detailed specifications. Here's what's now working:

✅ IMPLEMENTED EFFECTS
🎵 Signal Strength (S-Meter)

S1-S9 scaling: Volume adjusts from 10% to 90% based on selection
Weak signal simulation: S1-S3 are very quiet, requiring concentration
Strong signals: S8-S9 are loud and clear
🌊 QSB (Fading)

Slow fading cycle: 7-second fade in/out pattern
Realistic depth: Fades between 20% and 100% volume
Continuous effect: Runs throughout training session
"Breathing" signal: Mimics ionospheric propagation
🎛️ Chirp Effect

50Hz frequency shift: Tone slides from lower to target frequency
50ms duration: Quick chirp at start of each dit/dah
Vintage radio simulation: Mimics tube-based transmitters
Up-chirp pattern: Frequency rises on key-down
🔑 Straight Key

Timing irregularities: ±20% random variation in element duration
Variable rise/fall: 3-10ms rise time, 5-15ms fall time variations
Human-like keying: Simulates hand-operated key timing
Imperfect spacing: Natural operator "fist print"
📡 QRM (Interference)

Competing CW station: 75Hz offset from main signal
Random morse patterns: Sends A, B, S, O, W, C, D at 25 WPM
30% interference level: Audible but not overwhelming
3-8 second intervals: Random timing between QRM bursts
🔊 Background Noise

Pink noise profile: Realistic HF band atmospheric noise
S3-S9 noise levels: Graduated noise floor simulation
Continuous background: Persistent throughout session
Scaled mixing: Prevents audio clipping
🧪 TESTING THE EFFECTS
How to Test:

Start training session (click Start Training)
Enable effects in Advanced Settings section:
☑️ QSB (Fading) - Listen for volume "breathing"
☑️ Chirp - Notice frequency slide at start of tones
☑️ Straight Key - Hear irregular timing
☑️ QRM (Interference) - Listen for competing CW
Adjust settings:
Signal Strength: Try S3 (weak) vs S9 (strong)
Noise Level: Try S5 or S7 for background hiss
Real-time changes: Toggle effects during training
What You'll Hear:

Clean signal: Modern electronic keying (no effects)
QSB enabled: Volume fades up/down every 7 seconds
Chirp enabled: "wee" sound on each dit/dah
Straight Key: Slightly irregular timing, like human keying
QRM enabled: Competing morse code 75Hz off-frequency
Noise S5+: Background atmospheric hiss
🚀 READY FOR TESTING
The advanced audio effects are now fully functional! All the realistic HF propagation and equipment characteristics from your specifications have been implemented:

✅ QSB fading with 7-second cycles
✅ Chirp with 50Hz/50ms frequency slides
✅ Straight key with timing variations
✅ QRM with competing CW at +75Hz
✅ Signal strength S1-S9 scaling
✅ Pink noise background (S3-S9 levels)
✅ Real-time effect toggling during training
✅ Console logging for debugging
