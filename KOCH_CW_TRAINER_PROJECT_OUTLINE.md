## üìû Questions for Clarification ‚úÖ **ANSWERED**

1. **Character Display Timing**: ‚úÖ Appear after the audio, with a delay which can be set
2. **Session Length**: ‚úÖ Should be user-configurable 
3. **Progress Persistence**: ‚úÖ Tied to user accounts (server-side storage)
4. **Mobile Experience**: ‚úÖ Should work on Android and Apple phones
5. **Audio Fallbacks**: ‚è≥ To be determined during implementation
